---------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.29

Visual Studio项目使用的Fortran编译器。

:ref:`Visual Studio Generators` support selecting among Fortran compilers
that have the required Visual Studio Integration feature installed.  The
compiler may be specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of
the form ``fortran=...``. CMake provides the selected Fortran compiler in this
variable. The value may be empty if the field was not specified.
