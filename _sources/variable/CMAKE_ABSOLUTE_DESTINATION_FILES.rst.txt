CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
--------------------------------

使用\ ``绝对目的地路径``\ 安装的文件列表。

This variable is defined by CMake-generated ``cmake_install.cmake``
scripts.  It can be used (read-only) by programs or scripts that
source those install scripts.  This is used by some CPack generators
(e.g.  RPM).
