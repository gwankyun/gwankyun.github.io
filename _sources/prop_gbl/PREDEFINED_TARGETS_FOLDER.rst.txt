PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
-------------------------

CMake自动添加目标的FOLDER名称。

If not set, CMake uses "CMakePredefinedTargets" as a default value for
this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the
:prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property.
