SOURCES
-------

它指定目标源文件的路径列表。以下命令都设置或添加到\ ``SOURCES``\ 目标属性，并且是操作它的\
常用方法：

* :command:`add_executable`
* :command:`add_library`
* :command:`add_custom_target`
* :command:`target_sources`

Contents of ``SOURCES`` may use
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
If a path starts with a generator expression, it is expected to
evaluate to an absolute path. Not doing so is considered undefined behavior.

Paths that are for files generated by the build will be treated
as relative to the build directory of the target, if the path is not
already specified as an absolute path.  Note that whether a file is seen as
generated may be affected by policy :policy:`CMP0118`.

If a path does not start with a generator expression, is not an
absolute path and is not a generated file, it will be treated as relative to
the location selected by the first of the following that matches:

* If a file by the specified path exists relative to the target's source
  directory, use that file.
* If policy :policy:`CMP0115` is not set to ``NEW``, try appending each
  known source file extension to the path and check if that exists
  relative to the target's source directory.
* Repeat the above two steps, this time relative to the target's binary
  directory instead.

Note that the above decisions are made at generation time, not build time.

See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.
